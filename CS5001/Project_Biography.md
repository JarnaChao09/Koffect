# Personal Biography

## Name: Jaran Chao

# Skillset / Project Sought

I am highly passionate about Programming Language Theory and Design (PLTD), focusing specifically on its applications to Numerical and Scientific computing. Specifically, I am interested in how programming languages affect the code we write day to day and how different paradigms and perspectives in language choice allow for expressive and elegant solutions with a focus on numerical methods, mathematical theory, and scientific computing.

I am experienced with many advanced mathematical topics such as Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, and Discrete Mathematics primarily focusing on symbolic and numerical computation. I also have experience in lexing, parsing, type theory, ISA design, code generation, and compiler design. I bring a diverse set of skills for addressing any PLTD, numerical, or scientific computing workloads.
