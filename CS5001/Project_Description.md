## Project Information
### Topic Area

This project is a research-oriented project focusing on the applications of context-oriented/context-aware programming
to general purpose programming. From applications of contextual rigor (such as mathematical proof writing), to resource 
management (such as opening and closing files/connections/sockets), to domain specific languages, programming contains 
a lot of implicit contexts and mental context management. This project aims to create a language around the concept of 
explicit contexts to reduce the mental gymnastics and boilerplate needed to maintain context dependent code.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to research and implement a general purpose programming language specializing in 
context-oriented programming.

Some areas of focus that this project hopes to tackle are:
- The application of context-oriented programming to tackle metaprogramming challenges
- The application of context-oriented programming to model other context dependent fields such as mathematical proofs
- The application of context-oriented programming to model real world contextual dependent situations in code with minimal boilerplate
- The application of context-oriented programming to the creation and modelling of domain specific languages
